# Zelig version 5.0-14

## Major changes

- Initial development on a new testing architecture and more tests for 
`model-ls`, Zelig 4 wrappers, Zelig workflow, and `ci.plot`.

- `graph` method now accepts simulations from `setx` and `setrange`. For the 
former it uses `qi.plot` and `ci.plot` for the latter.

- Improved error messages for Zelig 4 wrappers.

- Improved error messages if Zelig methods are supplied with too little 
information.

- `model-arima` now fails if the dependent variable does not vary for one of the 
cases.

## Minor changes

- Minor documentation improvements for Zelig 4 wrappers.

- Dynamically generated README.md.

- Removed plyr package dependency.

- `rbind_all` replaced by `bind_rows` as the former is deprecated by dplyr.

- Other internal code improvements
