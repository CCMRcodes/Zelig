Zelig (noun) /ˈzɛlɪɡ/ : An entity with chameleon like characteristics, able to change appearance and form to fit appropriately in any circumstance.

Leonard Zelig was born in Brooklyn, New York at the turn of the century into a Jewish immigrant family. He gained notoriety and celebrity status during the 1920s due to his supernatural ability to look and act like whomever was around him. F. Scott Fitzgerald penned in his memoirs of meeting Leonard Zellman, a charming and impeccably dressed aristocrat, at an affluent garden party in Long Island. Lou Zelig turned up soon after at the New York Yankees spring training camp in Florida. Later, he was seen as a member of Al Capone’s Cosa Nostra and a black jazz musician in Chicago. Leonard inspired Woody Allen’s 1983 fictionalized documentary film, Zelig, about this "chameleon man"" who changed his appearance and persona to comfortably blend into his surroundings and integrate himself into important historical events. Similarly, Zelig: Everyone's Statistical Software is intended to fit in every situation, and to work for every model and approach.
